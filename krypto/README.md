## Krypto

### Introduction and Rules
Growing up, my school district had a math and science olympiad for the elementary schools. This event had several students from each school grades 4-6 compete in STEM games. Every year, I was selected to compete in Krypto. In Krypto, players recieves a hand of five cards with values ranging from 1 to 25.  They use this hand to arithmetically acheive a six card which is set as the "goal".  A more thorough ruleset can be found here: [Game Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypto_(game))
